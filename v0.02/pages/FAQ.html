      I treasure my customer database, how do I make sure that my data is
      secure?<br /><br />
      Great question. This is a major issue in outsourcing. No matter how many
      iron-clad non-disclosure agreements you try to have a vendor sign, unless
      you can really trust who you’re working with – there really is no other
      way to protect your data. Once you’ve got your data in the hands of a
      company you trust, there are other measures you can take to keep it
      secure. Like, simply having your database stored on-site in your office
      and having a few of our designated agents draw from the database to make
      or handle calls. There is also the option of transporting the data to our
      location, and having it stored on a secure, fire-walled server to prevent
      break ins or any chance of data theft. If you have highly sensitive data,
      like credit cards and social security numbers, we can plan out your
      security needs accordingly and have them addressed before you
      outsource.<br /><br />
      What kind of services do you provide? Is it just inbound, or do you do
      outbound as well?
